= faker-fu

Faker == Faker, but more.

= Faker

A port of Perl's Data::Faker library that generates fake data.

== Usage

  require 'faker-fu'

  Faker::Name.name => "Christophe Bartell"

  Faker::Internet.email => "kirsten.greenholt@corkeryfisher.info"

== Installation

  gem install ffaker

and then

  require 'faker-fu'

The API is pretty much the same as the old Faker gem.

Fork it/ping me if you feel like adding more goodies to it.
